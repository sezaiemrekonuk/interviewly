## 2026-08-11 — `change_avatar` tool

Added the tool the interviewer's turn can carry (`avatar: 1|2|3` on `ConductorTurnSchema`) to
swap its own live expression, HR persona and technical persona each getting three independent
slots. See `DECISIONS.md` ADR-ADD01 for the reasoning; this is just what changed and where.

**Backend**

- `packages/ai/src/schemas.ts` — `avatar` optional field on `ConductorTurnSchema` (1..3).
- `packages/ai/prompts/interview.conduct.turn.v3.prompt.yaml` — new version (v1/v2 untouched,
  K9). Adds a "YOUR EXPRESSION" instruction and `avatar` to the reply-JSON template.
- `backend/modules/interview/avatar.ts` — new. `currentAvatar(interviewId, personaId)` (Redis
  read, defaults/clamps to 1) and `applyAvatarChange(...)` (clamp → compare → write + SSE
  publish, no-op when the request repeats the live value).
- `backend/modules/interview/avatar.test.ts` — unit test: clamp on read, no-op on repeat,
  write+publish on a real change, ignore out-of-range. Mocks `redis` and `./sse`.
- `backend/modules/interview/conductor.ts` — `personaForRound` now returns the persona `id`
  (was name + system_prompt only); after a turn comes back, `turn.avatar` (if present) calls
  `applyAvatarChange`, best-effort, logged on failure, never blocking the turn. `ConductorReply`
  gained the `avatar?: number` field.
- `backend/modules/interview/sse.ts` — new `AVATAR_CHANGED = 'INTERVIEW_AVATAR_CHANGED'` const;
  `eventNameFor` recognizes it so the stream sends the right event name.
- `backend/modules/interview/state.ts` — `resolvePersonas` reads `currentAvatar` for the active
  persona and adds `avatar` to the `persona` object in `GET /state`'s response.

**Frontend**

- `frontend/src/lib/query.ts` — `InterviewStateResponse.persona` gained `avatar: number`.
- `frontend/src/lib/use-interview-events.ts` — `INTERVIEW_AVATAR_CHANGED` added to the nudge
  list (still payload-blind, per the room's SSE contract).

**Verified**

- `npm test` — 103 files / 1003 tests pass (new `avatar.test.ts` included).
- `npm run typecheck` — clean.
- `eslint` on every touched file — 0 errors (2 pre-existing ignore-pattern warnings, unrelated).

**Not done here (see ADR-ADD01 "Skipped"):** no avatar images, no `persona-tiles.tsx` wiring —
that component doesn't render an `<img>` at all yet. The backend now hands the room everything
it needs (`persona.avatar`, an SSE nudge on change); rendering it is a `frontend`/`interview-core`
task for whoever owns those ledgers.

## 2026-08-11 — real avatar art seeded

Owner supplied 6 photos (`~/Downloads/out/square/*_pose{1,2,3}.png`, 256×256): 3 poses each of
a man and a woman. Mapped woman → Ada (HR), man → Turing (tech) — the two persona names read
that way, and the mapping is a one-line swap if wrong.

- Copied into `backend/prisma/fixtures/avatars/{ada,turing}-{1,2,3}.png` (repo-tracked, small
  enough not to need LFS).
- `backend/prisma/seed.ts`: `putImage` now takes real bytes + content type (defaulted to the
  existing placeholder webp, so every other call site — mascot, the 5 `AvatarState` keys — is
  unchanged). `seedPersonas` uploads the 3 fixtures per persona at
  `personas/{personaId}/expr-{n}-{sha256_of_real_bytes}.png`, `avatar_set[expr-n]`, content-
  addressed by the actual file (not the shared placeholder sha, since these three really
  differ). This is exactly the key the `change_avatar` tool (`avatar.ts`) and `GET /state`'s
  `persona.avatar` were already built to point at — no change to either.
- **Verified against the running stack**, not just unit tests: rebuilt the `api` image,
  temporarily published dev ports (`compose.dev.yaml`) and ran `npm run seed` (via a transient
  `npm install tsx` — the runner image ships no dev deps, so the seed script only runs from a
  full checkout or with tsx added ad hoc). Confirmed in Postgres that both personas' `avatar_set`
  now carries three `expr-*` PNG keys with distinct real shas, confirmed those objects serve as
  `200 image/png` at the real file size through the edge (`/assets/personas/.../expr-*.png`),
  and re-ran the seed a second time to confirm the upsert is still a no-op (same shas, same
  keys). Reverted the container back to its normal state and ports afterward.
- Still not wired into `persona-tiles.tsx` (see the entry above) — the real art is at the
  expected keys, ready for whenever that UI task happens.
